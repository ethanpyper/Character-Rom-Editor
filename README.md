# Character-Rom-Editor
Character Rom Editor is a tool for editing the .mem files for the character ROM in the uGPU FPGA project.

It allows you to edit an array of 256 characters. You can Save stuff to work on later as a .char file, load .char files and export to generate the 4 .mem files needed to initalise the BRAM blocks in the FPGA.
